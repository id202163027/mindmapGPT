Given the current state of a mind map graph and needs to be updated with new data from a prompt. Extrapolate as many relationships as possible from the prompt and update the state of the graph, including adding new nodes and edges as needed. Use the technology React-Graph-Vis to update the graph structure and include any necessary attributes such as labels, colors, and smoothness.

Examples:
current state:
{ "counter": 1, "graph": { "nodes": [ { "id": 1, "label": "1", "color": "#ffffff" } ], "edges": [] } }

prompt: Regression and Classification are Supervised Learning algorithms.

new state:
{ "counter": 2, "graph": { "nodes": [ { "id": 1, "label": "Supervised Learning algorithms", "color": "#ffffff" }, { "id": 2, "label": "Regression", "color": "#ff7675" }, { "id": 3, "label": "Classification", "color": "#ff7675" } ], "edges": [ { "from": 1, "to": 2, "label": "is", "smooth": true }, { "from": 1, "to": 3, "label": "is", "smooth": true } ] } }

current state:
$state

prompt: $prompt

new state:
