Given the current state of a mind map graph and needs to be updated with new data from a prompt. Extrapolate as many relationships as possible from the prompt and update the state of the graph, including adding new nodes and edges as needed. Use the technology React-Graph-Vis to update the graph structure and include any necessary attributes such as labels, colors, and smoothness. Graph structure with nodes and edges may contain duplicate ID values. Check for these duplicates and replace them with unique values so that each node and edge in the graph has a distinct ID. It is important to preserve the relationships between nodes and edges in the process.

Examples:
current state:
{ "counter": 1, "graph": { "nodes": [ { "id": 1, "label": "1", "color": "#ffffff" } ], "edges": [] } }

prompt: Regression and Classification are Supervised Learning algorithms.

new state:
{ "counter": 2, "graph": { "nodes": [ { "id": 1, "label": "Supervised Learning algorithms", "color": "#ffffff" }, { "id": 2, "label": "Regression", "color": "#ff7675" }, { "id": 3, "label": "Classification", "color": "#ff7675" } ], "edges": [ { "from": 1, "to": 2, "label": "is", "smooth": true }, { "from": 1, "to": 3, "label": "is", "smooth": true } ] } }
